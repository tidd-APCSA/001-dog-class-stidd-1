1. Create the Dog.java class: 

Include the following class variables:
* name
* breed
* weight (as a double)
* color
* houseTrained (boolean)

All class variables should be declared lowercase

Write a constructor that takes all of the above as formal parameters.


2. Create one getter method for each class variable. 



3. Test your code with the Main.java class:

Create at least three Dog objects using the constructor and print their fields/states with your getter methods. 

4. Add a toString method that simply returns the name of your dog and a dog emoji 🐶
